================
I'm always disracted by the projects around me more then actually doing my work. Moving SVN to GIT? Cool. Packaging up a new binary? Cool. Databse Migration scripts? Cool. Actually adding features and never using new tools? Not cool. I now know what I have been interested in is DevOps. It's grest for the endlessly curious and ADD peron. This insatiable curiousity lead me from my degree in computer science to now a principal engieer and team lead for a new team.

I started off my career in QA Automation and spent 5 years enjoying manufactoring software and playing Sheepshead. After Hewlett-Packard got my resume, I moved to work in firmware in Boise, Idaho. I was laid off under a year later and was hooked. Now that my dreams of retiring from them decades later was shattered, I moved around. A lot. My specific pedigree isn't as important as how much I love DevOps.

On my personal time I enjoy my fmaily: a husband, 2 kids, my parents and my sister. It's a messy household and it's my world. For fun I spend a lot of time scuba diving and mentoring other women into the industry and accellerate their careers. Also, I love the [matrix](http://janemiceli.github.io/matrix/).
